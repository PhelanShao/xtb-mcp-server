# IR Spectroscopy Template for XTB
# This is essentially a frequency calculation, as IR spectra are derived from vibrational frequencies and intensities.

$chrg {charge}
$spin {spin_multiplicity}
$gfn {gfn_version}
$alpb {solvent}

# Frequencies are calculated from the Hessian
$hess
  temp={temperature}        # Temperature for thermochemical analysis and broadening
  # pressure={pressure_atm} # Pressure (optional)
  # ssc={anharmonicity_flag} # For simple quasi-harmonic correction (e.g., ssc=true)
$end

# SCC settings are important for accurate Hessians
$scc
  temp={scc_temperature} # Should be consistent with $hess temperature or calculation conditions
  # etol, maxiter, etc. can be specified if defaults are not sufficient

  # For IR, xtb typically outputs vibrational frequencies and intensities in the main output.
  # Specific keywords for direct IR spectrum plotting might not be available in .xcontrolrc itself,
  # but post-processing of the output (e.g., xtb.log or xtb.json) is common.
  # Ensure relevant vibrational data is printed.
  vibrational_frequencies=true # Placeholder, xtb usually prints this by default with $hess
  ir_intensities=true        # Placeholder, xtb usually prints this by default with $hess
$end

# It's crucial that the geometry is optimized before an IR/frequency calculation.
# This template assumes an optimized geometry is provided as input.
# If optimization is needed first, it should be a separate step or a combined $opt $hess run.
